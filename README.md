<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Many times I quit daily meditation because of excuses like too tired, too busy, too much works, etc.. Even though I understand meditation helps me to relax and become healthier. So I made this timer. Just ONE minute a day, dive shortly but deeply. And it still helps well. At time over, the handbell ring sounds. It's a very soft sound to make sure you won't be disturbed if you want to continue.</p>
